        <section class="column word_split2">Let's be honest, you were going to buy this product even if it was a picture of a toilet taped to a piece of cardboard. So let's all stop pretending that it REALLY matters what type of product we present to you. Because at the end of the day you're all simple minded consumers that we've succesfully brainwashed into believing that everything we produce was made by God himself. </section>
        <section class="column">So enjoy our manifestation of corporate greed as we bring you the latest and greatest in Apple's long line of consumer hypnosis. We hope you enjoy the HomePod as much as we've conditioned you too!

        <section  class="column">We at Apple wanted to ensure that you could never take the HomePod anywhere but your dining room table. And what better way to accomplish this than to make the HomePod the most stainable color known to man. Now you can constantly worry about getting it dirty or having literally anything sit close to it. What's that you say? You'd like to use the HomePod in your kitchen? Well good luck with that beloved customer, because we've made sure that accidentally staining your HomePod is as inevitable as your mom being disappointed in your life choices! </section>
        <section class="column">We are glad that you're going to hate this color as much as we intended you to. Enjoy the first couple months spent vigourously cleaning around your HomePod, until one day some of that grease from the delicious fried chicken you made for dinner spatters all over your new HomePod! Then, you can come running back to your friendly neighborhood Apple store to start the process all over again with a brand new HomePod. </section>

                <section class="column">Truth be told, the inside of the HomePod looks nothing like this. In reality the HomePod's inner workings is made up of a plastic rod glued to an iphone speaker. This ensures we get the most money from our consumers because it literally costs nothing for us to pay the unfortunate Chinese kids over seas to make this "school-project" of a speaker. </section>

We've succesfully created a speaker out of thread that is perfect for snagging on just about anything you can think of! Never worry about your speaker being to practical ever again; because with the HomePod we've ensured that practicallity is nothing more than a whisper in the wind. Some might think that a snaggable speaker is idiotic, counterintuitive, and maybe even a little torturous; but hey, we're apple and we don't give a $*&@ what you think. </section>

        <section class="column">You know all of those times you went over to that one weird families house that made you use coasters for your drinks? Well now you can experience that same awkward confusion with your very own coaster-ready home speaker! The brand new HomePod is a terror to the wooden furniture in your house. Basically, just write down all of the spots you'd like to put your HomePod and you'll have compiled a list of all the places you'll need to use a coaster in order to sit your HomePod down.  </section>
        <section class="column"> During one of our weekly product meetings we asked "How can we create more frustration for our users, and sell our new Apple coasters at the same time?" Well dear customer, we found a way. We have lathered a very specific acid on the bottom of all of our HomePods that will negatively react to any surface you place it on without a coaster. Pretty savage of us right? Well deal with it because you know there's nothing you can do. Oh and don't forget to pick up your Apple Coaster.</section>
